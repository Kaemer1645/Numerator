# Numerator


This is short python program to change file names in indicated directory.

To create this I used PySide2, Auto-py-to-exe and some basic python libs.

To create GUI I used Qt Creator to generate .ui file and after that I convert this to python code by:

pyside2-uic mainwindow.ui > ui_mainwindow.py
and the same I did with qrc file.
